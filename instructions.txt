The newly generated .cube files can be opened in VMD. 

1) Optimize geometry (can combine both of them)
bonus: add solvents when doing host-guest chemistry
2) Frequency check (Opt Freq)  -  vibrational analysis from which thermodynamic 
parameters can be calculated (like delta G, delta H, delta S)
Can also tell if the optimized strcture is global minimum or global maximum
(if all the IR peak frequencies are positive, it is your most stable structure)
Confirm you have a transition state (all positive outputs, one negative frequency, the last one)
3) Single point - total electronic energy 
(electron density, electron population, electronic properties, redox active,
fluorescent, nmr, ir, raman, cd, nmr titration)

TD-DFT UV-VIS

Dynamic simulations can also be done with Gaussian

Mulliken charge is found in the gaussian output, and has no real applicability.
Natural bond orbital theory (NBO) is more usefull
